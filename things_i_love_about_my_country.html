    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>Venezuela is the country where I was born, and it is a place that continues to live in my heart, even if I am far away. There are many things I love about my country, and when I think about them, I feel happy, nostalgic, and proud. In this article, I want to share some of the things that I miss and appreciate the most: the landscapes, the food, the traditions, and especially the people.</p>

    <h2>1. The Beauty of the Landscapes</h2>
    <p>One of the most amazing things about Venezuela is its natural beauty. The country has many different types of landscapes, and each one is special in its own way. If you travel to the west, you can see the Andes Mountains, which are tall, green, and full of fresh air. In the south, there is the Gran Sabana, a huge area with flat mountains called <em>tepuyes</em> that are millions of years old. The most famous of these mountains is Auyantepui, which is the home of <em>Salto Ángel</em>, the highest waterfall in the world. When you look at it, you feel small but connected to something very big and ancient.</p>

    <p>On the coast, Venezuela has more than 2,000 kilometers of beaches. The Caribbean Sea is warm, clear, and peaceful. Some beaches are full of life, with people swimming, dancing, or eating delicious food. Other beaches are quiet, almost empty, where you can read, relax, or watch the sunset without noise. One of the places I love the most is Los Roques, a group of islands with water so blue that it looks unreal. It feels like paradise.</p>

    <h2>2. The Food That Brings Comfort</h2>
    <p>Another thing I love about Venezuela is the food. Venezuelan dishes are full of flavor, color, and tradition. The most famous food is the <strong>arepa</strong>, which is a round corn bread that you can open and fill with almost anything you like. You can eat it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and everyone has their favorite style. Some people fill it with cheese, others with beans, chicken, or avocado. My favorite is the <em>reina pepiada</em>, made with chicken and avocado. It is creamy, fresh, and delicious.</p>

    <p>We also have <strong>empanadas</strong>, which are fried corn pastries with fillings inside. Many people eat them on the beach, still warm and crunchy. Another popular dish is <strong>pabellón criollo</strong>, the national dish, made of rice, shredded beef, black beans, and sweet plantains. The mix of sweet, salty, and soft textures is perfect.</p>

    <p>And of course, we cannot forget <strong>hallacas</strong>, which are traditional at Christmas. Making hallacas is a family activity. Everyone helps: one person prepares the meat, another spreads the dough, another wraps the hallaca in a banana leaf. Eating them feels like celebrating family and tradition.</p>

    <h2>3. Celebrations and Traditions Full of Joy</h2>
    <p>Venezuelans love to celebrate, and our traditions are full of music, dance, and color. For example, during Christmas, people go from house to house singing <em>gaitas</em>, a type of music from the state of Zulia. In December, many families also light fireworks or gather to eat typical Christmas food.</p>

    <p>One of the most unique traditions is the <strong>Dancing Devils of Yare</strong>, a celebration where people dress as colorful devils and dance in the streets to celebrate the victory of good over evil. This tradition is so unique and beautiful that UNESCO declared it Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p>

    <p>Another celebration I love is Carnival. People enjoy the beaches, wear costumes, dance in parades, and celebrate life with joy. It is a moment to relax and enjoy the good things.</p>

    <h2>4. The Warm and Friendly People</h2>
    <p>But if I have to choose the best thing about Venezuela, I would say the people. Venezuelans are known for being friendly, open, and warm. Even when life is difficult, they try to help others and stay positive. If you meet a Venezuelan, you will probably receive a smile, a joke, or an invitation to eat. People like to talk, laugh, and spend time together.</p>

    <p>There is a strong sense of community. Neighbors share food, families gather every weekend, and friends stay connected even when they are far away. I love this feeling of closeness and solidarity. It makes me feel at home.</p>

    <h2>5. A Feeling That Stays With You</h2>
    <p>For all these reasons—its nature, food, celebrations, and people—I feel very proud of my country. Venezuela is not perfect, but it is full of beauty and heart. Even if I live in another place, the memories, the smells, the music, and the flavors stay with me. They remind me of who I am and where I come from.</p>
